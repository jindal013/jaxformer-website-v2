description: "When we run algorithms on hardware, we're bounded by three things: how fast our computer can do math (OPs/second), the bandwidth available for moving data around (bytes/second), and the total memory available to store data (bytes). These “roofline” constraints let us upper and lower bound the time of a given computation."
